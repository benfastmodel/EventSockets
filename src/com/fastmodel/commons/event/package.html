<h1>EventSockets</h1>
<h2>A Lightweight Object Event Framework</h2>

<p> The purpose of this framework is to provide a simple approach to implementing direct
	Publish / Subscribe, similar to that used by GUI frameworks, without requiring a lot
	of repeated boilerplate code.  This is not an Event Bus or Grand Central Dispatch
	eventing framework.
</p>

<h3>Events</h3>
<p> Events in this framework are identified by their type.  All events must implement
	{@link IEvent}, which is a simple tagging interface.  While this interface wasn't
	strictly necessary, it helps ensure that event objects are appropriately declared.
	It also serves as the base for two specialty variants.
</p>
<p> Event types implementing {@link ICancelableEvent} will abort event processing if
	the fired event object returns <tt>true</tt> from {@link ICancelableEvent#canceled()}.
</p>
<p> Event objects of types implementing {@link IClonableEvent} will be cloned prior to
	each listener call.  Ordinary event objects are simply passed to each registered
	listener in turn.
</p>

<h3>Listeners</h3>
<p> Listeners can be created either as instances of {@link IListener}, or as methods
	of the listening object, using the @Listener annotation.
</p>

<h3>Event Sockets</h3>
<p> Rather than requiring objects which expose (or fire) events to implement a plethora of
	add*Listener and remove*Listener methods, the class exposes one Event Socket method
	for each event type.  The value returned by the Event Socket method has the appropriate
	add and remove methods.  The term Event Socket reflects the notions that event listeners
	are plugged into the event they listen for.
</p>
<p> By convention, all Event Socket methods are named <tt>on<i>EventType</i></tt>.
</p>

<h3>Event Services</h3>
<p> A class which wishes to expose events should have a private member of an appropriate
	Event Service type.  The Event Service provides methods to get Event Sockets and to
	fire events.  While the Event Sockets are expected to be part of the public interface
	of the class, the firing of events is generally part of the private (or protected)
	implementation.
</p>
<p> There are two base types of Event Services, which both implement {@link IEventService}.
	The {@link SimpleEventService} is for classes which only need to expose a single event
	type.  Such classes will typically expose a single Event Socket, named either <tt>onEvent</tt>
	or <tt>on<i>EventType</i></tt>.  The socket is obtained by calling {@link SimpleEventService#getSocket()}.
</p>
<p> The {@link MultiEventService} is for classes which need to expose multiple events (i.e.
	multiple event types).  In addition to supporting the socket for the root event type,
	the MultiEventService has the {@link MultiEventService#getSocket( Class eventClass )}
	method, which allows event listeners to be bound to a specific event type.  It also
	supports binding all listeners on an object at once, using {@link MultiEventService#getAnnotationSocket()}.
	See the {@link Listener} annotation's documentation for more details.
</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
	class EventA implements IEvent { ... }
	class EventB implements IEvent { ... }

	class ExposesEvents {
		private MultiEventService&lt;IEvent&gt; eventService = new MultiEventService&lt;IEvent&gt;( IEvent.class );

		public onEventA() {
			return eventService.getSocket( EventA.class );
		}

		public onEventB() {
			return eventService.getSocket( EventB.class );
		}

		public onEvents() {
			return eventService.getAnnotationSocket();
		}

		public action() {
			// ...
			if ( someCondition ) {
				eventService.fire( new EventA() );
			} else {
				eventService.fire( new EventB() );
			}
		}
	}

	// A sample of direct listener registration:
	ExposesEvents model = ...;
	model.onEventA().addListener( new IListener&lt;EventA&gt;() {
		public void handle( EventA ) {
			// listener code goes here
		}
	} );

	// A sample of annotation listener registration:
	class HasListeners {
		@Listener
		public void onEventA( EventA ) {
			...
		}

		@Listener
		public void onEventB( EventB ) {
			...
		}
	}
	HasListeners myObject = new HasListeners();
	model.onEvents().addListenersFor( myObject );
